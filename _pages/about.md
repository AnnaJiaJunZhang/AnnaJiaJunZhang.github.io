I'm a second year PhD student from [LCD lab](https://sites.google.com/view/lcdlabcuhk/home), [Department of Psychology](https://www.psy.cuhk.edu.hk/), [the Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html/). My research interest includes children's literacy and cognitive developmental, parental impact on children's academic development, home learning/literacy environment.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tomohiro Inoue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JWPWRUUAAAAJ&hl=ja) of LCD Lab from CUHK.
